Todo-list app with sorting functionalities

This a basic TODO-LIST app with some functionalities such as 
 1.Adding your task
 2.Marking a task as complete
 3.Deleting a task 
 4.Sorting the task by categories as completed,uncompleted,all
 5.Stores the tasks in Localstorage i.e the tasks remains even you refresh the page or visit again
 
 This can be improved by storing the state of the task i.e it stores the task but not its state (completed,uncompleted) feel  free to pull and improve
 
 P.S: I kinda uploaded twice ignore it
 
 ThankYou  /:)
